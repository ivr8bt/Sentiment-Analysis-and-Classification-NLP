There's only one main street and about a block in either direction but there is so much to do for everyone in the family. We enjoyed the cattle drive. Even with large crowds on eclipse weekend there was plenty of room to see the bulls and cows walk down the street. The massive horns were within reach of the first row of visitors. If you miss the cattle drive you can see the herd in their paddock. There is horseriding (and riding a cow for a picture) a maze a stage coach and wagon a mechanical bull and many stores and restaurants. There is also a rodeo arena and a couple of Western themed museums. Very family friendly. There is also a functioning historic train station and the train pulls right into the middle of what looks like a shopping mall. The vibe was more adult in the evening with a number of bars and honkytonks.

While the area felt safe I was kind of surprised that main street is still a street for vehicle traffic. Especially when it's crowded making the area a walking zone might be a good idea.

garcia_tripadvisor2_fortworth_watergardenthingstodo.docx,"4 This place is at the southern end of the core downtown business district. I had visited it years ago when I lived in Fort Worth briefly but I did not recall much about it. We were in the area and had 30 minutes before a nearby lunch appointment so we stopped by.



We arrived around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday. There were a lot of people around and it seemed safe at that time; I'm not sure what it is like in the evening though.



We were able to find street parking about 2 blocks away. It was free at the time (I think the parking meter said that it was free on weekends and after 6 p.m. but you should double check that if you are using a metered space).



There are at least 2 entrances to the park at opposite corners. There appeared to be 3 different water features surrounding a small plaza in the middle. There were also stone-capped landscaping / walls surrounding the place.



The first and most popular feature is a sort of inverted ziggurat where the water flows down into the lowest point. There are block stairs (no railings) via which you can access the low point and look up at the terraces. We descended here and checked it out. It was interesting but can get crowded.



The next feature is a sunken pool surrounded by walls. You can descend a staircase and be at pool level. I think it is supposed to be a more serene setting.



The final feature is a slightly sunken pool with spray heads at intervals creating a spray level about 3 feet above the pool along with shifting rainbows if it is sunny out.



If you are in the area and have at least 30 minutes this is worth seeing just for the novelty. Kids seemed to like it too mostly for the opportunities for climbing on rocks or steps.",4.0,things to do,"4 This place is at the southern end of the core downtown business district.

The collection includes some well known names - Michelangelo Monet and others. A lot of it was focused on European and Biblical themes. There is also an Asian section and a small special exhibit of early Central American art. I found the main collection to be pretty narrow. Most works include extensive descriptions of the piece - they point out details that may go unnoticed but it can also get tiring.



There are two buildings. In my opinion they are poorly laid out in terms of accessibility or avoiding weather (it was cold and wet when I went); it was tiresome and probably impacted my enjoyment of the art. I'm not appreciating the buildings as much as others do. Most staff was friendly; but they seemed rude when I approached sections that were not clearly closed off (a simple ""section closed"" sign would be helpful).

Jiahao NOLA Hotel Review.rtf,"5 Simply put there is really no comparison. The Windsor Court has the best location best staff best facility - it’s the whole experience. Once you enter the courtyard it feels safe and secluded despite being in the middle of downtown. You can easily walk to the French Quarter river or Warehouse District. The valet team might be the best I’ve ever seen in any location. And of course the rooms are huge and very comfortable. The Polo Lounge on the second floor remains one of my favorite places to relax after a long day. There’s just nothing like the Windsor Court.

1 I had high hopes for this hotel as my husband and myself list New Orleans several times a year and are looking for a hotel that can consistently meet our needs. We were to stay two days this time. However a train came rolling by during the night making so much noise that sleeping was impossible. I had specifically requested a quiet room when I made the reservation so I felt that failure to inform me of the train noise was nothing less than totally negligent. When they were informed the next morning of my total inability to get any sleep the prior night no other arrangements accommodations or discounts were offered. As a result we checked out after only one night and will never return.

5 Always Amazing! The Windsor Court is my favorite hotel anywhere – especially in NOLA! The location staff suite layout amenities doormen Club Floor lounge lounge staff and food/drinks are top notch! Every staff member greets you with a smile and kind word. We stayed recently for four nights in a Club Premium Suite to celebrate a birthday. We arrived back in the room one night to find champagne chocolate covered strawberries and a birthday card! The view from our balcony allowed us to watch the boat traffic on the Mississippi River. This was our 5th stay over many years and it is always perfect. A special shout out to Megan Uram Plauche. Also a big thank you to Christopher and Marissa in the Club Lounge for their exceptional service and warm and caring hospitality. Extra special thank you to Kaomi in the Club Lounge for making the best Kahula Mud Slide I have ever had! The area is very walkable. Casino across the side street Mother’s (NOLA local food) a few blocks away the best charbroiled oysters at Dragos in the Hilton nearby. Easy walk to the WW2 Museum – highly recommend the Beyond All Borders movie. Close to the River Walk and Shops and of course Café du Monde. Also highly recommend Mansion's Luxury Car Service for airport transfers. Can’t wait to come back!
2 Avoid this hotel which no longer lives up to its acclaim! Although once a favorite destination for us this recent visit has ruined all our fond memories. The service was no better than at other New Orleans hotels and worse than at several. The guest rooms appeared old dreary with fabric stains faded depressing colors of carpeting and painted surfaces. Old electronics without a nice selection of TV stations no music listings no USB power at bedside a complicated wireless access system and dreary appearance of hallways and other public areas. The Grill Room restaurant which was once an exquisite and exceptional dining experience has dropped its standards with food preparation wine selection table service dress code and menu selection to the point of not being worth the time or money. Too many other New Orleans offerings!
3 Sadly I did not experience the perfection that others seem to have. I do have a very solid attention to detail though so here are my thoughts. The lobby is pretty - it was decorated for Christmas and gave a great first impression. We had a suite that was large and spacious. At first glance it looked very elegant. However if you looked closely a lack of upkeep was apparent. For instance the toilet roll holder was hanging off the wall and clearly broken; the toilet seat slid around so I fell off to the side several times; there was lots of dust including an atrocious amount behind the night stands and on the plugs; lots of dark scuff marks were on the walls. I will say that the bed was very comfortable. We also had a few minor problems like bath towels not being replenished room service occasionally not picking up our dirty dishes after we pressed the call button and briefly getting stuck in an elevator that went slightly haywire. Staff was fine but they never said hello or acknowledged us when we walked through the lobby which I find odd. Also if you get a room facing the river there will be noisy train sounds throughout the night. For the price we paid I feel like this hotel was sufficient. But I do want to share my experience given all the glowing reviews.

cmiel_tripadvisor1_boyntoncanyon_great.rtf,"5 Incredible! It snow the night before we hiked and everything was just gorgeous. We were so fortunate to have a totally sunny morning. Most of the trail was snow covered on the way out and what wasn't was wet but not muddy. The Boynton Canyon trail was fairly easy and the 1/2 mile spur to the cave was too BUT climbing up into the cave was challenging especially with wet rocks! Two couples did not even try. Once you get up you are at the back of the cave. When you turn around you have the most incredible view even more so with the snow I think! I am so glad we did not miss it! Getting down was more difficult than getting up. My husband went down before me and help me or I don't think I could have done it. When we got down we found out we could have walk around a very narrow ledge to the ruins and come down a rocky trail! By the time we headed back it had clouded up and the much of the snow had melted making the trail more slushy.

cmiel_tripadvisor1_boyntoncanyon_okay.rtf,"2 We drove to the Boynton Canyon trailhead and started our first official hike. A 3 mile (each way) hike through the canyon. We actually got a slow start even though it was about 9:30 when we got there. Beautiful landscapes all around us and a blue sky made it a perfect day.As we started up the trail there were trees cactus brush Red rocks and soil. Within 10 minutes we came to a trail marker that offered us the chance to continue on the path we were on or a short detour to the Boynton Vista. So we chose the vista which offered us a great view of the area and a spire at the end of the trail was said to be a vortex. 

After climbing back down we again stated up the original trail meeting other hikers coming back down. Most said it was an easy trail although it was rated at moderate. We got to a point where it was all boulders and the hike was going to turn into more of a mountain climb. As we stood there we decided to wait for a family of hikers who were coming back down the trail. They were voted out of continuing up the trail by the infant on the back of the one woman who was screaming the whole time. An older couple coming back from the end of the trail soon followed and stopped to tell us what to expect. They said it was worth seeing the end because you stand at the edge of a huge valley looking out. They also said the trail gets a little tougher near the end. Near the end? Where we were standing looking toward the trail ahead of us it was already tougher than we a couple of “newbee” hikers wanted to attempt. As we were talking suddenly from the direction we were traveling towards came a loud boom of thunder and the sky was growing incredibly dark. So I made the decision to turn around. Hike called due to thunder and major rocky trail. On the way down we were passed by a family with 2 small children (under ten) who were coming back from the top of the trail. The daughter was leading the way almost running because she was scared of thunder. We got back to the car and you could see the rain coming our way. The forecast never mentioned rain today and I had had my fill of getting wet the past two days.

There are many options when you start from Broken Arrow TH which is off Morgan Rd near town. It's popular with mountain bikers too esp Hogs Wash loop.  I've hiked this 2 times in my 3 visits to Sedona.  Previously we did the classic BA to Submarine rock (amazing) to Chicken Pt. Great hike and not too long. Little shade but amazing views of surrounding mountains (360 degree view). You can avoid traffic by taking the trail rather than Jeep road. Slight detour to left to get to submarine rock. There are 2 - go to top via slick rock climb and it's epic. Then continue down to Chicken pt where most Jeeper congregrate as there is a steep hill there.   This Dec 2022 we did this starting from BA and then went to High on Hogs (nice views from lookouts there). Similar to a submarine. Then as you ascend its got some very nice view of below. Bikers do this trail so watch out. You continue either to Hogs Wash or loop back to BA via Twin Butte trail.   Great hikes esp so close to Sedona town and great 2-3 hr hikes. Get away from crowds esp on weekends from more popular (Cathedral Bell Rock Devils Bridge) . It's a very diff experience and view given it's 360 vantages esp from Submarine rock.

cmiel_tripadvisor1_brokenarrow_okay.rtf,"3 The trail is 1.7 miles one way from the parking lot to Chicken Point. The parking lot and trailhead are at the end of Morgan Road which is the third (?) roundabout when going south out of Sedona on Highway 179. There is a small parking lot (no facilities) just beyond the end of the paved portion of Morgan Road.

Broken Arrow Trail is an easy well-used trail suitable for novice walkers and those without heavy duty hiking gear. It climbs steadily from the parking lot to Chicken Point. Views from Chicken Point over the surrounding countryside and to the red rocks beyond are great.

The downside of the Broken Arrow Trail is that it parallels a jeap trail which at times can be quite busy and noisy. If you want solitude on the trail and at Chicken Point set off early in the morning when the temperature is still cool and the jeep tours haven't yet got going. If you get to Chicken Point before 11am you'll beat the crowds! Going back you can watch the jeeps doing their acrobatics (see pics) while still admiring the view.

cmiel_tripadvisor1_westfork_good.rtf,"4 The West Fork Trail is about 35 minutes away from Sedona it’s a nice drive all along plenty of nature to watch & once you get to Coconino National Forest Park look out for the signs to the West Fork trail (north bound) sign will be to your left on the driver’s side.
Parking is scarce but if you go on a weekday the wait is 10 or 15 minutes at most it costs $10 for the whole day & there are a few picnic tables so pack a few sandwiches fruits & drinks...you’ll need it after a long day at the trail. Also there’re bathroom facilities at the site.
As for the trail itself it’s about 7.8 miles( both ways) 3 to 4.5 hrs depending on your age or how many breaks you use for picture taking. The scenery is spectacular as well as breathtaking from little streams to enormous boulders to all kind of paths you’ll be challenged at times but it gets easier as you go along. Once you get to end of there’s a sign advising people that from there on you’ll have to wade your way around the river if you want to continue that’s for experienced hikers.
Now it’s time to come back the same way you came in it’s a bit faster considering that now you’re more familiar with the route.
We saw a little & beautiful snake on the stream (non poisonous) at the beginning of the trail it was a brief & exciting moment unfortunately I wasn’t fast enough to get a pic of it but on the brighter side we got pics of a squirrel & few birds.
All in all it was a great experience & there’s nothing more satisfying than completing the trail from beginning to end. This trail is a must out of many that Sedona has to offer.
Enjoy it !!

gutstein_tripadvisor1_rochester_holidayinnexpress_terrible.txt,"1 Had to stay one night after an emergency brought us to Mayo. The room that was promised on the phone was not what we got. We had called before booking due to a specific request for a room with a couch so my mom could sleep upright after her fall. When asking to be moved the front desk person told us that was all they had. Her initial solution was to cancel the reservation instead of looking in they system to see if there was the room we booked available. It was pouring rain and my mom had a traumatic fall so I was not going to move hotels at that point. When pressed the room magically was available. On top of that this hotel is just run down and dirty. One of the pillow cases had blood stains on it. And to top it all off the air conditioner was broken. My mom was beyond exhausted so we just had to stay there and deal with it. I would not recommend anyone stay at this location. There are so many other choices right there that will surely be better than here.

 ",1.0,hotel,"1 Had to stay one night after an emergency brought us to Mayo. The room that was promised on the phone was not what we got. We had called before booking due to a specific request for a room with a couch so my mom could sleep upright after her fall. When asking to be moved the front desk person told us that was all they had. Her initial solution was to cancel the reservation instead of looking in they system to see if there was the room we booked available. It was pouring rain and my mom had a traumatic fall so I was not going to move hotels at that point. When pressed the room magically was available. On top of that this hotel is just run down and dirty. One of the pillow cases had blood stains on it. And to top it all off the air conditioner was broken. My mom was beyond exhausted so we just had to stay there and deal with it. I would not recommend anyone stay at this location. There are so many other choices right there that will surely be better than here.

The bathtub/shower bottom was ""sticky"" the entire time and I suspect that no one ever gives it a good scrub. The bed was unusually hard and the pillows were both hard AND lumpy.

gutstein_tripadvisor3_rochester_bestwestern_crowded.txt,3 When arriving the hotel looked awesome! Nice rooms and a fun pool area for all ages for a family reunion group of 22 people. While it is understandable to have a full and busy hotel that does not account for the numerous people using the pool without being guests. On Saturday it was clear that hotel staff made no effort to keep the pool at a reasonable number of people for max capacity or safety. There were 3–4 birthday parties and a wedding on one day. Many people coming into the hotel in groups breezed by the front desk caring gifts and wearing bathing suits. The main pool was standing room only which was unsafe for anyone using the big slide or standing near the bottom. The toddler pool was overrun with preteens playing volleyball and other kids were sprinting the hallways like it was a track. Any table left attended in the pool area was quickly taken and/or moved to be used for party goers. There was literally no place for our large group to go except for the breakfast area to sit and visit and even that was extremely noisy with all the running screaming kids through the hotel and in the lobby area. While I am sure this was a fun party environment for NON-PAYING partygoers it’s at the loss of our business as our family reunion will not be returning in the future.,3.0,hotel,3 When arriving the hotel looked awesome!

haoyxu_tripadvisor1_stowe_harrisonrestaurantreview.txt,"5 This is my third year coming to Stowe but my first time finally snagging reservations at Harrisons. From now on this is a ""must-go"" restaurant every time I come to the area. For those of you who are on the fence let me say this -GO without hesitation. It is worth every penny. There are no pictures anywhere on the internet which do this place justice especially during the Christmas season. I travel frequently and have favorite restaurants all over the country - but this is now my favorite hands down. The food and service were excellent. In a town of fine dining gems this was still better than all of them. But the hidden secret here is the ambiance. For Christmas it feels like you're in a cozy cabin parlor - stockings hung from the fireplace small twinkle lights tastefully adding to the vibe a crackling fire and an arrangement of booths and tables which are all close - but also somehow very intimate. Quite simply if you are looking for the most romantic restaurant you've ever imagined this one would have to be pretty close to the top of the list. Having visited all the other fine dining places within 15 miles in the past two weeks this one still dominates. Simply amazing.

5 We went to Harrisons again and I haven't reviewed this restaurant in a while because sometimes when restaurants are so spectacular so consistently you take it for granted. I just didn't want to take it for granted in this case and just let everybody know how incredible this restaurant is and how consistent it is. The food the atmosphere the service it's just five stars across the board and has never faltered. And I have been coming here for a very long time and I mean decades. So kudos to Andrew and everyone there and I highly recommend this restaurant. It's not only one of the best in Stowe and Vermont but I would say in the country!

5 Cosy restaurant with great ambiance and decor with seating in booths and stand-alone tables. Excellent service from staff. Good starters but the mains were the stand our stars including tenderloin venison and NY strip - hands down gold star for the river trout dish which was outstandingly prepared seasoned and cooked with lovely accompaniments. Solid desserts offerings finished off an excellent experience and highly recommend eating here.
We had a wonderful dinner at Harrison's on our last night in Stowe. Staff was friendly and efficient and our food was great. My husband loved the Harrison burger and I had the very yummy watermelon and avocado salad!

1 We went into Harrisons a little after 5. We did not have a reservation. When we went in there were parties seated at 3 or 4 of the tables. After a somewhat extended wait we were asked if we were there for dinner. When we responded that we were we were asked if we had a reservation. We said that we did not. The hostess turned around and looked at the several empty tables paused and turned to us and said ""Well I am unable to seat you now but you could come back at 9:30 tonight"". We noticed on the way out that the restaurant closed at 9:30! No idea what was going on. Obviously we didn't fit the profile.

1 I used this restaurants online table reservation website and submitted my reservation for 8:30 on October 10th. Upon arriving and giving our name they told us we weren't on the list and asked if I had received an email. After checking my email I found that they had set me up for October 13th at 7:30! I explained that there must have been some kind of mistake and they promptly told me that there was nothing they could do- if you're not on the list sorry for you! I was highly upset as we were celebrating our anniversary and I didn't appreciate being told it was my fault and they couldn't squeeze us in even if we waited! Beware of their online reservations!

3 We were super excited to go to the Harrison - it truly is lovely inside - very cozy and intimate. The staff was absolutely excellent - super kind and helpful. The cocktails were fine - nothing really stood out or made me feel like I'd absolutely need to go back for one. The food was OKAY. One of our party had the steak which was very very fatty and grizzly the au-poivre sauce was under-seasoned as well. One of our party had the chicken piccata which was tasty if not a bit greasy. The chicken was a bit on the tough side though. Again everyone was helpful and the hospitality was perfect. The food could just use a little help.

4 This was a mother/daughter getaway in Stowe and we both had eaten at Harrison's before so wanted to make it part of our stay. Everything was really nice. The atmosphere our server and most of the food. I do have to complain about one item. I asked the server whether the salmon was wild or farmed and she said it was wild (brought in for a local seller). When I received the dish it was obvious that it was not wild. The color was very light almost the color of tuna. My daughter asked me not to say anything so I didn't. I often eat wild salmon either sockeye or coho and farmed is much different. Not only the color but it also doesn't have omega 3s so it is not as moist. The flavor is much different. The cost was $35.00 so should have realized that wild would have probably been much higher. Other than the salmon the rest of the food was very good. I will go back again but next time will not order the salmon.

rector_tripadvisor2_convenientneedsupgrading.txt,"3 This large hotel has dominated the south end of the Kona strip for decades. It still offers convenient lodging but is in need of an upgrade and modernization (which they appear to have started). Beds are very comfortable but furnishings overall are dated. The restaurant and bar offer great ocean and sunset view but the cuisine itself is average at best.

It still offers convenient lodging but is in need of an upgrade and modernization (which they appear to have started). Beds are very comfortable but furnishings overall are dated. The restaurant and bar offer great ocean and sunset view but the cuisine itself is average at best.

jaipuriyar_tripadvisor3_hyattpalacetampadt.txt,"5 Great Hotel - super large rooms. I really appreciate the decor and colors. Most hotels these days all look the same with a bland neutral color palette and the same modern design. Hyatt Place actually had some color while still being calming and not in your face. The showers had a good water pressure which I feel is rare to find in a hotel.
The location is excellent and about a 10-15 minute walk to Amalie Arena (we were staying for a concert there). The staff was friendly the place was clean kept up well everything in working order check in and out were quick and easy. My only minor complaint is that there is barely any counter space in the bathroom. I would definitely stay again if I need a place in downtown Tampa.

We stayed a week in room 145 a drive up we could park right at our door. Now the inn is old  over 70 years old but our room was fine. Clean quiet we felt safe there. NO BUGS believe me I looked. We had two comfortable queen beds a small frig and microwave. The bathrooms have been redone no tub but a nice shower. On one side is a huge Lutheran church and parking lot on the other side a Chick a fila and Burger King. We met 2 front desk staff both men both nice and professional. When we checked in we could not get the tv working the front desk fellow came right down and showed us what to do. All the staff around were friendly- the maids the maintenance guys. Close to airport and central for us. They said they'd clean the room every 3 days and just ask for towels no problem getting more clean towels. The in house restaurant Pach's place is open for breakfast and lunch. Lots of locals there which was a good sign. Yummy food good prices. Yes you can sit outside by a Koi fish pond if you wish. The inn is dog friendly we saw 2 in the week we were there no barking issues. the pool is not heated but I'm from Canada so I swam in it nice lounge chairs by it. In all Tahitian Inn was way better than I expected  had a relaxing week in Tampa would stay there again.

My husband and I took advantage of their ""locals"" discount in April/May where the prices are discounted for Vermont residents. We stayed one night but we got there early in the day to take advantage of the tours that are included with the stay. We went out to Ben & Jerry's (buy tickets ahead of time for the 30-minute tour or just go hang out on the beautiful property and get a scoop while you walk around). Then we had lunch at the Biergarden. Cheddar Lager soup was divine and very filling. The pretzels were hot and delicious and the beer cheese was on point. The Johannesburger was solid - not the best we've ever had in our whole lives but you won't be disappointed! 1pm tour of the Sugaring House - Bob was our guide and he was VERY entertaining. The walk was completely doable even though there is some uneven ground and a pretty decent hill. He stopped a lot along the way so you never felt out of breath. Bring a fiver to tip him afterwards (not required just nice). At 3 we got tea and cookies in the lounge and enjoyed them on the back patio. Then we played Scrabble in the library. Went back to the room and rested for a bit and then got ready for dinner. Went to the main dining room for the chef's tasting menu (available on Tuesdays). It was delicious: Scallop Ceviche Caesar salad Beef Medallions (3 pieces each with its own sauce hashbrowns and carrots on the side) other main dish was Pheasant under glass. Dessert was a chocolate sacher torte (cake) with raspberry couli. I didn't love the dessert but chocolate cake is not my thing. Also it was HUGE. All the portions were regular sized not tasting sized. Bed was comfy - LOVED the pillows. We went to the gift shop and got a Trapp Family Lodge Christmas ornament and then went to our 9:30AM tour to meet the cows. OMG DO THIS!! They are beautiful Scottish Highland cows and the history behind how they came to the farm is interesting and our guide Chris Poche (""Poacher"") was awesome and entertaining. You are walking with the cows as they are grazing. Then we checked out of our room and we were planning to go on the 1PM Chapel tour but we decided to head into Stowe for lunch. Main St Cafe has nice sandwiches so we enjoyed the curried chicken salad on a GF bun and roast beef with provolone on wheat with extra horseradish mayo.

I also requested a late checkout and the day of checkout I was woken up to a message from the lodge saying that it was unavailable at 9:30am and I had till 11am to checkout. At checkout I discovered I was charged additionally for a breakfast package that I didn’t receive or was notified. Also on leaving I saw that the room had also increased in price by over $50.

We were so impressed with the food we have been going there ever since. The food & the service is phenomenal everyone treats you as family and welcomes you and knows your name. Dave the owner and chef is always available during dinner to come by and say hello and welcome you to his restaurant. This Mother's day as in some Easter Brunches we sometimes get to hear him sing along with the old vintage organ up in the balcony during Brunch. My wife and I are always amased: How is it possible you can love every single dish on his brunch menu which is quite large? Multiple choices of appetizers and main courses. And every single one including his home made desserts are all excellent his recipes are right on target! Specially my favorite Irish Pudding.

Steps to the Chicago loop (L train) and steps to the Magnificent Mile. I feel like you can walk everywhere…. Close to Navy Pier as well. The hotel is stunning view from the rooftop (which is a happening posh place for those socialites out there). I prefer the morning brunch. The rooms are fabulous and the bed was a dream. The entire team and staff we associated with were so helpful concierge providing great recommendations to watch the Euro cup. A special shout out to Corey who was there to support us with anything we needed. We were given a fantastic upgrade offer.

At check-in despite trying to discuss the view we were ignored and given an alley view as though that was a river view. Asked for something different- were told that because we booked through a third party (our airline) they had no interest in our honours membership. Paid a lot more than the estimated amount for our 6 night stay for an upgrade. Fine. Only to get the same short curt negative vibe at checkout. Meanwhile the guests next to us were being asked about their experience and if they could do anything else. I have traveled extensively to many luxury hotels and never felt the urge to leave a complaint. But especially after the checkout this left a very bad taste for what should have been a positive experience. If the hotel doesn’t want third party bookings then do not book through them.

yun_tripadvisor4_chicago_londonhouse_terribleservice.txt,1 Unfortunately this was a VERY DISAPPOINTING experience and will never use nor refer them again. (I am a Chicagoan who enjoys stay vacations the amenities and roof tops). I planned a bachelorette using all of their services from the spa to the hotel stay and roof top for brunch the next day anticipating smooth service and it was anything but that. I took my time to make this special reservation months ago and when I attempted to get into our suite at check-in time at 4p it was not ready. We did not get in till 5:30p where I had to push back our dinner reservations which is not easy w a party of 8 on a Saturday night. This also cut into my fun activities I had for the party in the suite which we were not able to enjoy. I also requested a city view that was noted in my reservation and instead got a room facing a brink wall. Upon return that evening for sleep learned we did not have the needed pillows sheets and blankets where I called the front desk. 40 min went by and still no pillows sheets and blankets. Called a second time to get them. Then we had the room till noon the next day where house keeping knocked about a half hour before this time. Through this experience learned how much 3rd party things are used which hindered management being able to further assist. Warning when you visit the main site for London House it is a 3rd party number not the direct line. Not impressed w London House or Hilton. Also tired of hearing about new staff clearly management is failing from the top down.

yun_tripadvisor5_chicago_londonhouse_inconveniences.txt,"3 This was such a mixed bag stay but at the end of the day fell short of the 4-star status the hotel boasts.

First the positives:
-excellent location
-gorgeous building with awesome architecture
-excellent atmosphere
-great staff
-Nicolette at the desk leveraged my diamond status to upgrade me to a beautiful 15th floor corner suite with gorgeous views of the city and river. She was very kind and helpful throughout the stay.
-room was spacious chic clean comfy bed
-shampoo conditioner lotion shower gel all great
-bar is excellent with some great cocktails albeit pricey

The negatives:
-$76 valet parking is pretty pricey
-our room service drinks were fumbled at the door by the staff and shattered all in our room entryway
-worst hotel elevators in the business. There are at least 6 elevators working on an algorithm to prioritize space and efficiency yet they somehow take literally 12 minutes (I timed it) to get to you.
-our room key scanner died and it took 4 trips from the 15th floor to the lobby and back to get it sorted. We were held hostage in the room as the lock was reprogrammed and during the process the hotel staff “forgot a tool” which resulted in even further delays. This occurred around 2100 o a Friday night prime time to be out enjoying the city and we were unable.
-as we were held hostage in the room we tried to catch up on the NBA playoffs/watch a movie but the picture froze and went out constantly. Our TV was also wrecked covered in screen burn blue spots.
-the shower in the room is atrocious with the worst water dispersion head I have ever used along with very poor pressure
-the demographic that stays at this hotel seemed to be the drunk/high boorish type
